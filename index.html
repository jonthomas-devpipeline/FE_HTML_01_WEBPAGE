  <h1>Pineapple on Pizza?</h1>
  <h2>An Island Vibe with Every Slice</h2>
  <p>When people think pizza they immediately want to know what toppings will go on the pizza. You may first consider the classic toppings like pepperoni, olives and cheese. But there is always that one person in the back of the room that likes to stir the pot. "What about ham and pineapple?" They bring up to a chorus of groans and naysayers. But have they ruined the best dinner this side of fish sticks, or have they created the ultimate beach-side getaway?</p>
  <h2>Why so many adore the spicy fruit on pizza</h2>
  <p>Afficinados have several reason to crave pineapple on their pizza:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The fresh, spicy taste adds a splash to the more earthy pizza flavors</li>
    <li>Tomato and Pineapple is the unlikely dynamic duo they never knew who jive so perfectly together</li>
    <li>Pineapple cuts through some stronger ingredients on pizza, like the anchovy</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Haters will Hate, but on the chillest of fruit?</h2>
